# Disease Spread Simulator

This simulator shows how a disease may spread within a population grid.  Buttons, counters and a graph are implemented along with the grid to give the user more data.  JavaScript is used to handle all events happening on the page.

This disease spread simulator was made for and is owned by Fred Hutch.
